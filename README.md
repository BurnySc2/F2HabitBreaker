# F2HabitBreaker
Basic overlay to prevent the All Army hotkey being clicked in SC2

[Download](https://github.com/leigholiver/F2HabitBreaker/releases/latest)

Usage: Unzip and run `F2HabitBreaker.exe`

If your resolution isn't supported you can add a line to `F2HabitBreaker.csv` in the format *Resolution,Width,Height,xPosition,yPosition*

You can optionally add additional fields to control the colour and opacity of the overlay in the format *Resolution,Width,Height,xPosition,yPosition,r,g,b,opacity*

Right click on the overlay to switch monitors or quit. 

Currently it prevents mouse clicking on the command card. To change it back to blocking the F2 button, remove the 2nd entry in the `F2HabitBreaker.json` file surrounded by the curly brackets `{}`
