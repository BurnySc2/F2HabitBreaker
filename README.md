# F2HabitBreaker
Basic overlay to prevent the All Army hotkey being clicked in SC2

[Download](https://github.com/leigholiver/F2HabitBreaker/releases/latest)

Usage: Unzip and run `F2HabitBreaker.exe`

If your resolution isn't supported (default resolution `1920 x 1080`) you can add an entry to `F2HabitBreaker.json` and experiment with the `width, height, x-offset, y-offset` values until it fits your needs.

Right click on the overlay to switch monitors or quit. 

Currently it prevents mouse clicking on the F2 button. To change it so that it blocks the command card (bottom right) instead of the F2 button, remove the 2nd entry in the `F2HabitBreaker.json` file surrounded by the curly brackets `{}`.
